# Dataset content


- The dataset was found on Kaggle. 



# Business requirements



# Hypothesis and how to validate


In Machine Learning, a hypothesis refers to a model or function that you assume can predict the output from the given input data. It represents your best guess about how the input features relate to the target variable. 

 - Hypothesis 1 - Houses with 4 bedrooms appear to reach the highest prices, with one exceeding $700,000.  

 - Hypothesis 2 - Homes with smaller unfinished basements tend to have a wider range of sale prices. Sale prices are influenced by several factors and unfinished areas would be a major issue. 

 - Hypothesis 3 - Houses with larger amounts of square footage on the first floor generally cost more than houses with smaller amounts of square footage.

# Deployment



## The deployment process is done through Heroku. This site is used for this project as it is better for hosting backend files. Please follow the below steps to deploy this project:


- Create a Heroku accout if you haven't done so already. 

- Create a new app, give it a unique name and select your region from the options provided.

- Connect to GitHub (you might be asked to confirm login through the mobile app if you have it downloaded).

- Select the appropriate branch from which you want to deploy the project from. 

- Deploy the project. Keep an eye on the build log if the deployment fails, this will suggest any changes that need to be made in order to deploy successfully.
